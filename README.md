## Points to consider

- I could have made navbar sticky, so that it is visible in whole page. But for sake of simplicity and to do things faster, I avoided that.
- I have used tailwind css for styling and shadcn for build in components.
- I have tried my best to match css styles with provided figma design. But I spared most of time in code quality and logic. So I hope you can neglect some minor mismatch in design.
- I noticed that there is select element in budget input field of contact form. But for sake of simplicity I kept input element.
- I have not done error handling when handling api requests for now. But I know how to do that.
